# Joakim Jald√©n

Professionally I'm a Professor of Signal Processing at KTH Royal Institute of Technology. In my spare time, I am a happy hobby programmer with a particular focus on home automation at the moment. I am at the moment fluent in Matlab and C/C++ (incl CUDA), and am working to improve my Python skills. This said, I have over the years also programmed in Java, Assembly (Motorola 68x and Intel x86), Pascal and Basic, but have not maintained my skills with these languages. In the 90's, I was part of the Swedish Commodore Amiga Demo scheme, as a lead programmer for the group Limited Edition.
